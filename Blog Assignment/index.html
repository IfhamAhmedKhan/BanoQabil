            <p>Machine learning (ML) isn't new. However, the field of big data is revitalizing the subject and more organizations are relying on ML models to scale their operations, support staff in working better and faster, to uncover hidden insights from data, or even confirm and challenge underlying assumptions. This is creating widespread interest in related topics with the C-suite, and across business lines and job roles, as enterprises embrace the value of artificial intelligence (AI) and ML. To make a disruptive organizational impact, AI and ML need to be understood and trusted. By consulting these ML blogs from authoritative individuals and organizations that satisfy different skill levels, readers can increase their understanding and comfort level in these areas, get pressing questions answered, and connect with others who have experience using them to great benefit.</p>
